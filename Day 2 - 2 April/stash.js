//! STASH
// Git Stash allows you to temporarily save (stash) your uncommitted changes without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch branches or pull new changes but donâ€™t want to commit incomplete work.

//! Why Use Git Stash?

// Temporarily save changes without committing.
// Keep your working directory clean before switching branches.
// Restore stashed changes later when needed.
// Multiple stashes can be stored and applied selectively


git stash                       # Save uncommitted changes
git stash save "message"        # Save uncommitted changes with message
git stash list                  # List of all the stashes

git stash drop                  # Removes the most recent stash from the list.
git stash drop 'stash@{n}'      # Removes a specific stash from the list.
git stash clear                 # Removes all stashed changes.

git stash pop                   # Applies the most recent stash and then removes it from the list.

git stash pop 'stash@{n}'       # Applies a specific stash and then removes it from the list.
